A tool designed for reading others' c codes,which works on Linux OS.
Simply extract global declarations/variables and methods from given c file(s) 
and give a rude summary.

When developping the tool,i try to design some reusable codes 
and some testcases to test them.

All codes with fewer comments,however,the codes is readable.
